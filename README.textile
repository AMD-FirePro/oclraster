*Flexible Rasterizer in OpenCL*

This is the source code to my bachelor's thesis "Flexible Rasterizer in OpenCL". The intension is to write a fully functional and programmable software rasterizer in OpenCL.
TODO: abstract

Note: this is a partial "fork" of "a2elight":https://github.com/a2flo/a2elight (initialization, core, event and initial OpenCL/CUDA functionality)

*Software Requirements and Important Information:*
* on Windows:
** if you have an AMD GPU/CPU or an Intel CPU: please install the "Intel OpenCL SDK for Windows (64-bit)":http://software.intel.com/en-us/vcsource/tools/opencl-sdk
** alternatively (although not recommended due to performance issues): install the AMD APP SDK ("AMD APP SDK":http://developer.amd.com/tools/heterogeneous-computing/amd-accelerated-parallel-processing-app-sdk/downloads/#one)
** make sure to select the correct opencl platform in config.xml
* on OS X:
** please install the "latest XQuartz":http://xquartz.macosforge.org
** 10.7: OpenCL on 10.7.5 on non-CPU devices is broken, please use a CPU device for now or use an earlier version of OS X (or 10.8)
** 10.8: update to at least 10.8.3 (prior versions are majorly bugged)
** -if you have a Nvidia GPU, you can also use "CUDA":https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads (set the opencl platform value to "cuda")- currently defunct

*Requirements:*
* Windows: NT 6.0+ x86 (Vista/7/8/2008/2008R2/2012), NT 5.1/5.2 x86 (XP/2003) support is uncertain
* OS X: 10.7+
* Linux: any x64 distribution that supports the AMD, Intel or Nvidia OpenCL SDK/drivers
* OpenGL 3.2+ and OpenCL 1.1+ capable GPU/CPU and platform (GeForce 400+, Radeon HD5+, Core2+, Athlon64+?)
* OpenCL extension support for:
** cl_khr_global_int32_base_atomics
** cl_khr_global_int32_extended_atomics
** cl_khr_local_int32_base_atomics
** cl_khr_local_int32_extended_atomics
** cl_khr_gl_sharing/cl_APPLE_gl_sharing
* 1 GB RAM minimum, 2 GB RAM are recommended
* 256 MB VRAM minimum, 1 GB VRAM are recommended

*Build Instructions:*
* after cloning: git submodule init && git submodule update
* after a submodule update / pull: git submodule update

on Linux:
* install all necessary libraries (-> Credits; freetype2 and a2elight are not required/used, CUDA is optional)
* install clang 3.2+ and libc++ (currently 1101)
* run ./premake.sh
* make
* there is a install script located in lib/ which should be executed from that folder (will install to /usr/local/)
* alternatively:
** sudo ln -sf /path/to/oclraster/bin/liboclraster{,d}.{a,so} /usr/local/lib/
** sudo ln -sf /path/to/oclraster/lib /usr/local/include/oclraster

on Windows/MinGW:
* install custom MinGW builds "gcc-dw2-4.6":http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/rubenvb/gcc-dw2-4.6-release/ and "clang-3.2":http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/rubenvb/clang-3.2-release/ (thanks to "rubenvb":https://github.com/rubenvb for providing these!)
* install "MSYS":http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/External%20binary%20packages%20%28Win64%20hosted%29/MSYS%20%2832-bit%29/ to your MinGW folder
* build/install all necessary libraries (-> Credits; freetype2 and a2elight are not required/used, CUDA is optional)
* add a Windows system environment variable called "MINGW_ROOT" and set it to your MinGW root folder (e.g. "/c/mingw/mingw32/")
* run ./premake.sh
* make
* libraries and headers will be automatically installed to your set MinGW folder
* note: to make things easier, I might provide a full MinGW package containing all required libraries at a later point

on OS X:
* install Xcode 4.6+, Xquartz, SDL2 and SDL2_image (and optionally CUDA)
* compile oclraster.xcodeproj
* install/symlink oclraster .dylib and lib folder:
** if /usr/local or any sub-folders do not exist, create them (sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/{include,lib})
** sudo ln -sf /path/to/oclraster/bin/liboclraster{,d}.dylib /usr/local/lib/
** sudo ln -sf /path/to/oclraster/lib /usr/local/include/oclraster
* compile any samples you like
